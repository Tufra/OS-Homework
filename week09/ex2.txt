The example of increased hit/miss ratio: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5
with page frames = 5

Output:
5: 
 hits: 15 
 misses: 5 
 ratio: 3.000000

In this example each referenced page is already in memory, so there will be only 5 misses (at the beginning, when the memory is empty).
After that all references will be a "hit".
