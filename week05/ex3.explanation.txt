Every thread counts primes in specified range, which is equal for them except for the last one
(that one will have less work to do).
It means that overall execution time depends on time of the longest thread. It supposed to be
(n-1)th one. Because it has the largest (since last thread always hac <= elements)
amount of elements and also the largest of them (largest elements of full-size thread).
More threads => less amount of computations per thread => less execution time.
