In this task we use mutexes to avoid race condition.
As a result, protected code (getting a number and incrementing counter) makes
"ready" threads to wait when these operations will be available.
It creates a bottleneck, that causes worse execution time than in ex3 
and also describes, why there is almost no difference between 10 and 100 threads.
