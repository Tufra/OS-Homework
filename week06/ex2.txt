As we can see, both average turnaround time and average waiting time are better
in shortest job first algorithm. The reason is that shorter tasks are not forced
to wait for longer tasks that appeared earlier or at the same time as may happen in 
FCFS algorithm. It means that they have lesser waiting and turnaround time in average.
