The average metrics of round-robin algorithm are worse than
these of FCFS and SJF. That is because of simultaneous execution of 
all processes appeared. The execution time of every process depends on
the amount of other processes. It means that every process will take some 
number of rounds to complete, the more processes are executing - the longer 
single round will take.
